"""
External service adapters for Todoist and Google Calendar.

Domain Context:
- Translates between external APIs and domain models
- Handles synchronization of tasks and events
- Manages API credentials and rate limits

Business Rules:
- Todoist tasks must be mapped to domain Task model
- Calendar events must preserve managed/fixed status
- Task status updates must be synchronized
- Conflicts must be detected during sync

Architecture:
- Adapters implement Repository interfaces
- External service details are encapsulated
- Domain models are kept clean of API details

System Constraints:
- Must handle API rate limits
- Must manage API authentication
- Must handle network failures gracefully
